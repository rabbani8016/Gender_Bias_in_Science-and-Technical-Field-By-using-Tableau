Most of the man are doing engineering compare to women. The women are not prefering further for computer science and engineering. In engineering field graduate women are approximate same percentage from 2000-2015 and for computer science case its decresing.

Compare to other fields in helth related field they women are showing more interest. Engineering and computer science very less women are showing interest.

compare to other white there is very huge difference beetween man and women salaries.

Regarding the gender pay gap, it is a complex issue influenced by multiple factors beyond just the field of engineering and computer science. It is true that there are often significant disparities in salaries between men and women, with women earning less on average. These disparities are not solely based on gender but can also be attributed to factors such as occupational segregation, discrimination, lack of negotiation opportunities, and work-life balance challenges.
To address the gender pay gap, efforts should be focused on promoting pay equity, eliminating discriminatory practices, and fostering a culture of transparency and fairness in compensation. Policies such as pay audits, salary negotiation training, and flexible work arrangements can help create a more equitable work environment for all employees.
It is important to recognize and challenge the existing biases and barriers that hinder the participation of women in engineering and computer science. By promoting diversity, inclusivity, and equal opportunities, we can create a more balanced and thriving workforce in these fields.
One factor contributing to the gender disparity in engineering and computer science is the stereotyping and biases that discourage girls and women from pursuing these fields. From a young age, societal expectations, cultural norms, and media portrayals often reinforce the notion that engineering and computer science are male-dominated fields, leading to fewer girls considering these career paths.
Additionally, there are systemic issues within educational institutions and workplaces that contribute to the underrepresentation of women in engineering and computer science. These include biased recruitment practices, lack of female role models and mentors, and hostile or unwelcoming work environments. These factors can create barriers for women, making it more difficult for them to enter and thrive in these fields.
However, efforts are being made to address these disparities and encourage more women to pursue careers in engineering and computer science. Many organizations and initiatives are working towards promoting diversity and inclusion, providing support networks, and implementing policies to create more equitable opportunities for women in these fields.
